          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Designed to be incrementally adoptable, fledgling framework Vue is hailed as having one of the easiest learning curves in the client-side web application arena. In addition to benefitting from the lessons learned from frameworks that came before, Vue leverages core concepts from the Web Component spec, asking a question not nearly heard enough in the web development community: Do you really need JavaScript for that? This and more has Vue quickly becoming an exciting new option for building web applications. This session will cover two different ways to spin up a Vue app in under 5 minutes as well as the Vue basics of data display and manipulation.</p>

            <p>Carrie Scono started her journey into computer science after taking an intro to Java course in college and discovering programming can, in fact, be for girls. She graduated two years later from The Ohio State University with a dual degree in Computer Science and Actuarial Science. After a short stint at a financial institution in Columbus, she attempted to flee the great state of Ohio, only to land 20 miles short in Cincinnati where she is currently honing her full stack skills at Kroger.

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Compilers are the bridge between the code you write and the applications you run. While production compilers can be quite complicated, the principles of compiler design are not too hard to learn, and are broadly applicable to many seemingly difficult programming problems. In this session you will learn how every phase of a real compiler works, including lexing, parsing, type checking, optimization, and code generation. The lessons learned here will help you with many common programming problems, such as deserialization, maintaining large amounts of legacy code, static analysis, testing, and validation. In contrast to common Java-based compiler tutorials, I'll demonstrate how to build a compiler using functional programming techniques in F#. Full source code for a working compiler targeting the .NET CLR will be included!</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Web applications are going to take the native app stores by storm in 2018. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that work seamlessly for every user on every device, and they are ready to change the way we build and deploy our software. Each PWA is an application that works online or offline, on old devices and new, and that users can install just like a native app on your device. This talk will cover PWAs and the technologies that make them possible: Service Workers, Fetch API, and Web App Manifest. You'll leave this talk ready to create new PWAs and add native-like experiences to your existing apps.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>"How long will it take?" is something no developer likes to hear. Devs don't work in a vacuum; someone in the business will want to do some planning. This talk will start with why you need to be good at estimating and cover fallacies surrounding it (including its role in Agile). We'll discuss multiple ways to perform estimates with their pros and cons. You'll leave knowing why estimation is important with tools to make it easier and less scary.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Kotlin is a statically typed programming language by JetBrains that can enable more concise and understandable code than Java without sacrificing performance, safety or 100% Java compatibility. Spring Boot accelerates the creation of stand-alone Java/JVM based web apps with minimal coding. And Azure makes it straightforward to deploy and host Java/JVM based web apps. Come to this session and learn how we can use all of this goodness together to develop and deploy REST APIs. Attendees will learn how to use Kotlin and Spring Boot to develop a web app that exposes REST APIs. Attendees will then learn how to deploy and host this web app in Azure. We will wrap up things up by using a HTML/JavaScript client to test the REST APIs. The GitHub repository for this session will be made available beforehand so feel free to bring along your laptop to walk through the sample code together.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Unless the systems you build are developed with concurrency in mind, they probably do not take full advantage of modern multi-core CPUs. Concurrent programming facilitates the use of multiple processors, but is difficult to implement using traditional approaches. Fortunately, new approaches taken by functional languages have begun to address these difficulties.</br></br>In this highly interactive session, volunteers from the audience will help present the classic problems with concurrent programming. Traditional solutions to these problems will be presented, as well as new approaches available from functional languages such as Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell. With this knowledge you will begin to think about software architecture differently, and may even decide to introduce concurrency into your next project.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
              <p>Type 1 Diabetes sucks. People with this autoimmune disease have to constantly monitor & control their food, blood glucose, insulin, physical activity and other factors. Even with advancements like insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring, the process is still manual and error prone. What if someone with T1D could delegate the constant cycle of monitoring, predicting and controlling to a computer in their pocket? In this session, you'll learn about an open source project called the Open Artificial Pancreas System, or OpenAPS, and how it closes the loop on a cycle that the rest of us take for granted. Then we'll explore how Elixir and the Nerves project are being used to build a next generation artificial pancreas system. We'll touch briefly on the topics of hardware prototyping and reverse engineering along with how it all came together in one project.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Sir Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has called it his billion dollar mistake. The Pragmatic Programmer says that exceptions are a kind of cascading goto, which Edgar Dijkstra famously considered harmful. With so much of C# and the .Net framework built on these two concepts, code can quickly become littered with null checks and tightly coupled with exception catching. This talk is all about showing ways of writing and thinking about C# that can greatly reduce or remove null checks and exceptions. We’ll delve into why null is so dangerous, and see how code relying on exceptions can become entangled. Then we’ll see why an alternative approach produces code that has fewer defects, is more modular, is easier to test, and is easier to debug.</br></br>By being honest about the input and output of each of the methods you write you can reduce null checks and try catch statements.  Using classic OO techniques for polymorphism we can encode exceptions and branching logic within the type system so that the compiler helps us write correct code that has fewer defects.</p>

This talk will explain the sorts of problems that can be solved, what data is required to solve them, and what the results look like. And, we'll explore it using fun and geeky examples. We will cover six major types of problems that machine learning can solve: regression, forecasting, impact analysis, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. When we're done, you'll have a basic understanding of what machine learning can do and what you might want to use it for. I might even be something other than role-playing!</p>

              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>If you're doing front end development, chances are you have a favorite web framework. If you've been doing it for any length of time, you've probably had several. And with good reason: good frameworks have made our developer lives more productive and enjoyable. However, they continue to come along at a dizzying pace and each one is generally incompatible with the last. At the same time, browsers have continued to innovate and standardize many of the great ideas that web frameworks invented. It's worth asking ourselves if it's time to thank web frameworks for their service and climb off the treadmill. In this talk, I'll explore the experience of building a web app using nothing other than browser available APIs. We'll talk about some of the new browser standards that have been inspired by the best of web frameworks. We'll take a look at some good ideas in web app development that don't require a framework or API to implement. We'll do all this with plenty of code examples.</p>

                <p>When we survey the current landscape of emerging technologies such as Voice interfaces, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality - it's easy to become a bit disillusioned. Many of the early products can feel a bit gimmicky and not relevant to our day-to-day activities.

                <p>New features are constantly being added to Microsofts flagship language, C#, and the pace of this change is increasing. In the past couple of years, we welcomed C# 6 and C# 7, the last languages release of their size. Microsoft is now releasing updates to the language in point releases, since C# is no longer so coupled to Visual Studio. In 2017 alone, Microsoft shipped C# versions 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 without any sign of slowing. </br></br>Normally, sessions about new language features only happen well before the release of the new language, leaving you with time to forget everything you've learned by the time you're actually able to adopt the new language! In this fast-paced session, Brendan will show you the recent, practical improvements added to C# that you can take back with you and immediately start using to clean up and improve your own code. This is definitely a session you won't want to miss!</p>

                <p>If you've been programming long, you've had the experience of looking at your own code and struggling to understand it.  Worse yet is trying to understand other people's code.  Every piece of code you write not only instructs the computer, it also informs human readers.  What is it telling them?  In this session, you will learn to listen to what your code is saying. You will see how choices about scope, visibility, coupling, and cohesion reveal themselves in your code. You will learn principles and practices for creating eloquent code. Examples will be in C#, but will be applicable to any object oriented language. You will come away with new ideas to make your code speak clearly and inspiration to be more mindful while writing code.</p>

              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Until recently, developers have had to deal with some serious tradeoffs when picking a database technology. One could pick a SQL database and deal with their eventual scaling problems or pick a NoSQL database and have to work around their lack of transactions, strong consistency, and/or secondary indexes. However, a new class of distributed database engines is emerging that combines the transactional consistency guarantees of traditional relational databases with the horizontal scalability and high availability of popular NoSQL databases.</p>

                <p>Big data needs span both business users and developers across the world.  Most classical ETL and BI tools attempted to cater to this hybrid demographic resulting in cluttered GUI tools that were inflexible, inextensible, and frustrating to use.  Apache Airflow takes a different approach by representing tasks and config as Python code.
                  </br></br>
                  Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows composed of arbitrary tasks run on regular schedules.  Airflow provides a platform for distributed task execution across complex workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) defined by code.
                  </br></br>
                  Built on top of Airflow, Astronomer provides a containerized Airflow service on Kubernetes as well as a variety of Airflow components and integrations to promote code reuse, extensibility, and modularity.  The core of our stack is available as cloud hosted, on prem, and is also fully open source.</p>
